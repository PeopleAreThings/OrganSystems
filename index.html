        <h2>Model</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of this unit, we have discussed nearly every organ
          system. However, we have rarely made connections between
          them—especially with the digestive system. Here, I will show you how
          these systems work individually and how they interact with each other.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="A diagram of the digestive system and its connections"
        />
        <p>
          For this specific model, I will explain how the digestive system
          interacts with both the skeletal and nervous systems, as well as how
          each part works. Without further ado, let's get started!
        </p>

        <h2>Digestive System</h2>
        <p>
          Food entering the body starts at <b>1</b>, the mouth. Inside, a
          powerful enzyme called amylase begins breaking down complex
          carbohydrates, such as starch, into simple sugars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, at <b>2</b>, food enters the esophagus, where a process called
          peristalsis pushes it down into the stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the stomach at <b>3</b>, a combination of chemical and mechanical
          digestion breaks food into its core components. Peristalsis churns the
          food while enzymes break down complex carbohydrates, fats, and
          proteins into their base components. Once digested, the food moves to
          the small intestines (SI for short).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the SI at <b>4</b>, tiny hairs called villi absorb nutrients
          directly into the bloodstream, transferring them to other cells. At
          this point, all that remains are fiber, water, and electrolytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the large intestines (LI) at <b>5</b>, water and electrolytes are
          removed and sent to where they are needed. However, fiber and other
          indigestible materials are expelled as waste.
        </p>

        <h2>Skeletal System</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we understand how the digestive system works, we can explore
          its effects on the rest of the body—starting with the skeletal system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research shows that a healthy gut biome reduces inflammation, which
          can help with conditions like arthritis. Additionally, recent studies
          suggest that an unhealthy gut microbiome can lead to brittle bones,
          increasing the likelihood of fractures.
        </p>

        <h2>Nervous System</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, let's examine how the digestive system affects the nervous
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the brain, chemical neurotransmitters (which allow neurons to
          communicate) are produced by gut microbiomes. Without these
          neurotransmitters, symptoms of depression can develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, nerves outside of the brain can be affected by nutrient
          deficiencies resulting from a poorly functioning digestive system,
          leading to various diseases.

          <h2>M'kenna Case</h2>
          <p>
            During the course of the unit, we have all been, among other things,
            working on the <b>"M'kenna case"</b>. In this particular case, we
            take into account certain things about a patient named M'kenna and a
            strange disease that appears to be affecting their digestive
            system. We need to prove what she has. I will be defending my
            thought that it is Celiac, so what's wrong with her.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Put simply, she has begun to lose weight, experience fatigue,
            tiredness, & a few other symptoms without any changes in diet.
          </p>

      <section id="section3" class="content-section side-by-side">
        <div class="content-left">
          <h2>C.E.R. #1: Doctors Note</h2>
          <p>Claim: M'kenna has celiac. Evidence: In her Dr. Note, it says she has symptoms such as stomach cramps, fatigue, & vomiting. Reasoning: All of these are symptoms of celiac.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-right">
          <h2>C.E.R. #2: Weight Loss</h2>
          <p>Claim: M'kenna has celiac. Evidence: Celiac affects villi in the SI making them flatter and less effective. Reasoning: Thus, less nutrients will be absorbed, & more fat will be lost.</p>

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
          Homeostasis represents a complex, dynamic process through which living organisms maintain internal stability despite external changes. Within the human body, multiple organ systems work in intricate coordination to regulate and sustain optimal physiological conditions. This report explores the critical interactions between the digestive, skeletal, and nervous systems, demonstrating how these fundamental biological networks collaborate to preserve overall health.
        </p>

        <p>
          The digestive system serves as a primary gateway for nutrient acquisition and energy production. By breaking down consumed food into molecular components, this system transforms complex organic molecules into essential nutrients that fuel cellular functions. Enzymatic processes in the mouth, stomach, and small intestines deconstruct carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into absorbable forms. These nutrients are then transported through the bloodstream, providing critical resources for cellular metabolism, tissue repair, and system-wide energy distribution. For instance, calcium extracted from dietary sources directly supports bone formation, while proteins contribute to neural cell maintenance and regeneration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The skeletal system extends far beyond its fundamental role of structural support. This dynamic network of bones, joints, and connective tissues functions as a sophisticated mineral reservoir and biological scaffold. Bone marrow produces essential blood cells, while the skeletal structure provides crucial attachment points for muscular interactions. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are strategically stored and released based on metabolic demands, enabling precise physiological regulation. Moreover, the skeletal system acts as a protective mechanism, safeguarding vital internal organs and facilitating complex biomechanical movements through its intricate relationship with muscular and neural networks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functioning as the body's communication and regulatory infrastructure, the nervous system coordinates and monitors internal conditions with remarkable precision. Specialized neural networks continuously assess physiological parameters, triggering rapid responses to maintain equilibrium. Neurotransmitters and electrical signals enable instantaneous communication between different bodily systems, allowing for immediate adaptations to environmental or internal changes. When internal temperature fluctuates, neural mechanisms activate cooling or warming processes. Similarly, metabolic requirements prompt hunger signals or adjustments in energy utilization, demonstrating the nervous system's integral role in preserving homeostatic balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          These interconnected systems exemplify a sophisticated biological orchestra, where each component performs a specialized yet collaborative function. The digestive system generates essential nutrients, the skeletal system provides structural integrity and mineral management, and the nervous system orchestrates complex regulatory processes. Their continuous, synchronized interactions ensure efficient energy distribution, protect against potential disruptions, and maintain the delicate balance necessary for optimal physiological functioning. This intricate systemic collaboration highlights the remarkable complexity and adaptive capabilities of human biological design.
