        <h2>Model</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of this unit, we have discussed nearly every organ
          system. However, we have rarely made connections between
          them—especially with the digestive system. Here, I will show you how
          these systems work individually and how they interact with each other.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="A diagram of the digestive system and its connections"
        />
        <p>
          For this specific model, I will explain how the digestive system
          interacts with both the skeletal and nervous systems, as well as how
          each part works. Without further ado, let's get started!
        </p>

        <h2>Digestive System</h2>
        <p>
          Food entering the body starts at <b>1</b>, the mouth. Inside, a
          powerful enzyme called amylase begins breaking down complex
          carbohydrates, such as starch, into simple sugars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, at <b>2</b>, food enters the esophagus, where a process called
          peristalsis pushes it down into the stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the stomach at <b>3</b>, a combination of chemical and mechanical
          digestion breaks food into its core components. Peristalsis churns the
          food while enzymes break down complex carbohydrates, fats, and
          proteins into their base components. Once digested, the food moves to
          the small intestines (SI for short).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the SI at <b>4</b>, tiny hairs called villi absorb nutrients
          directly into the bloodstream, transferring them to other cells. At
          this point, all that remains are fiber, water, and electrolytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the large intestines (LI) at <b>5</b>, water and electrolytes are
          removed and sent to where they are needed. However, fiber and other
          indigestible materials are expelled as waste.
        </p>

        <h2>Skeletal System</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we understand how the digestive system works, we can explore
          its effects on the rest of the body—starting with the skeletal system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research shows that a healthy gut biome reduces inflammation, which
          can help with conditions like arthritis. Additionally, recent studies
          suggest that an unhealthy gut microbiome can lead to brittle bones,
          increasing the likelihood of fractures.
        </p>

        <h2>Nervous System</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, let's examine how the digestive system affects the nervous
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the brain, chemical neurotransmitters (which allow neurons to
          communicate) are produced by gut microbiomes. Without these
          neurotransmitters, symptoms of depression can develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, nerves outside of the brain can be affected by nutrient
          deficiencies resulting from a poorly functioning digestive system,
          leading to various diseases.

          <h2>M'kenna Case</h2>
          <p>
            During the course of the unit, we have all been, among other things,
            working on the <b>"M'kenna case"</b>. In this particular case, we
            take into account certain things about a patient named M'kenna and a
            strange disease that appears to be affecting their digestive
            system. We need to prove what she has. I will be defending my
            thought that it is Celiac, so what's wrong with her.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Put simply, she has begun to lose weight, experience fatigue,
            tiredness, & a few other symptoms without any changes in diet.
          </p>

      <section id="section3" class="content-section side-by-side">
        <div class="content-left">
          <h2>C.E.R. #1: Doctors Note</h2>
          <p>Claim: M'kenna has celiac. Evidence: In her Dr. Note, it says she has symptoms such as stomach cramps, fatigue, & vomiting. Reasoning: All of these are symptoms of celiac.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-right">
          <h2>C.E.R. #2: Weight Loss</h2>
          <p>Claim: M'kenna has celiac. Evidence: Celiac affects villi in the SI making them flatter and less effective. Reasoning: Thus, less nutrients will be absorbed, & more fat will be lost.</p>

        <h2>Report: Body Systems Working Together</h2>
        <p>
          Homeostasis is like a superhero team inside our body, working together to keep everything running smoothly and in balance. Just as a team of superheroes has different members with unique powers, our body systems each play a special role in maintaining our overall health and functioning. The digestive, skeletal, and nervous systems are particularly important in this intricate balancing act.
        </p>

        <p>
          The digestive system is responsible for breaking down food and providing energy and nutrients to the entire body. When we eat, our digestive system transforms complex foods into simple molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. These nutrients are crucial for providing energy to other body systems, including the skeletal and nervous systems. For example, calcium from our diet is essential for building and maintaining strong bones, while proteins and vitamins help nerve cells function properly and repair themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          The skeletal system does much more than just provide structure and support for our body. It plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis by protecting vital organs, producing blood cells in the bone marrow, and storing important minerals like calcium and phosphorus. These minerals can be released into the bloodstream when the body needs them, helping to regulate various biological processes. The skeletal system also works closely with the nervous system, providing attachment points for muscles that allow us to move and respond to our environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The nervous system acts like the body's communication and control center, sending electrical and chemical signals throughout the body to coordinate different functions. It helps maintain homeostasis by constantly monitoring internal conditions and triggering responses to keep everything balanced. For instance, when body temperature rises, the nervous system signals sweat glands to cool us down. When we need more energy, it can stimulate hunger signals or adjust our metabolism. The nervous system also works with the skeletal system by controlling muscle movements and reflexes that help us respond to our environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          These three systems are constantly communicating and working together to keep our body in balance. The digestive system provides nutrients, the skeletal system offers structural support and mineral storage, and the nervous system coordinates and controls everything. When one system is out of balance, the others can help compensate, demonstrating the incredible teamwork happening inside our bodies every moment of every day. This complex interaction ensures that we can move, think, grow, and stay healthy, showcasing the amazing design of human biology.
